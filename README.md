# Recognize landmarks on Columbia’s campus

This project aims to recognize landmarks on Columbia’s campus using VGG16, VGG19, and InveptionV3 as the pretrained models of transfer learning.

The dataset that has been collected for this assignment contains three landmarks on Columbia's campus: [Alma Mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater), [Scholars' Lion](https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/outdoorsculpture/tag/scholars-lion/), and [The Curl](https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/outdoorsculpture/tag/curl/). 


### Files

  - landmark: Folder that contains pictures for the three landmarks from different locations, orientations, and background conditions. It has already been separated into training, test, and validation sets.
  
  - Recognize_Landmarks.ipynb: Notebook that contains code for data preprocessing and transfer learning.
